            The Silent Struggle: Afghan Women and the Fight for Education
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In the 21st century, education should be a basic right for everyone, yet millions of Afghan women and girls are denied this opportunity. Schools and universities, once filled with bright and ambitious young women, now stand empty, their voices silenced by restrictions beyond their control.</p>

            <p>Education is more than just learning—it is freedom, independence, and hope for a better future. When a girl is educated, she gains the power to lift herself and her community out of poverty. She becomes a doctor, a teacher, a leader. But today, countless Afghan women are forced to abandon their dreams, trapped in a reality where learning is forbidden.</p>

            <p>This is not just an Afghan issue—it is a human rights issue. The world cannot remain silent while half a nation is kept in the dark. We must raise our voices, spread awareness, and stand in solidarity with Afghan women.</p>

            <p class="highlight">Their dreams matter. Their future matters. Their right to education matters.</p>
